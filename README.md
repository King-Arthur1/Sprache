Sprache
=======

A NuGet package for managing and using the Accept-Language header in C#.

### What Sprache Does

* Sprache helps you manage a list of language codes you support including the ability to map languages to fallback languages or really any language you want.

* Sprache can parse language preferences from the Accept-Language header

### Installation

Sprache is in very early development.  You can clone the repo and build the project in Visual Studio 2013 and use the dll.  A NuGet package will be available very soon.
